In this post, I'll give some more examples of measures and introduce an important topic concept in ergodic theory; measure preserving transformations.

One interesting space we often consider is the space of infinite sequences of numbers taken from some finite set which models rolling a die an infinite number of times. For instance, we could take our "alphabet" to be the set $$S = \{0, \, 1, \, \cdots \, n-1   \}$$ consisting of $$n$$ "letters". Words taken from this alphabet could look something like $$(0, \,  1, \, 0, \, 0, \, 0, \, 1, \, \cdots )$$  and the set of all such words $$ (a_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}}$$ is denoted $$\Pi_{i=1}^\infty \{ 0, \, 1, \, \cdots \, n-1\}$$. To construct a probability measure on this set, we should find some collection of simple sets to define their probability, and then we'll be able to find the measure of any unions, intersections, and complements of these sets. If our die is fair, we would expect that the probability of the Ith roll $$a_I$$ to be a particular number $$\omega_I \in S$$ is $$1/n$$. Thus we define $$\mathbb{P}(\{ (a_i)_{i \in \mathbb{N}} : a_I = \omega_I   \}) = 1/n$$ for all rolls $$I \in \mathbb{N}$$ and letters $$\omega_I \in \mathbb{N}$$.
